# Gitty

>Gitty is a chrome extension that allows users to leave code reviews on Github files.
>You can download our chrome extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitty/lbelcompobjfpedpgnpfdojjfokgaghf):

>Built with the Chrome Extension and Github APIs, Mongo, Angular/Angular Material, and Node.
>You can highlight/comment on any github file as long as you're a collaborator.
>The highlights and comments get catalogued, so you can always refer back to them at that particular file URL.
>We recommend you comment on files in commit trees.  That way they can continue to persist.
